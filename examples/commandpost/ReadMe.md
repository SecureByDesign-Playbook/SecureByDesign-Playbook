# Defending Command Posts
(TBC)

## Background

"Command Posts" here are fielded headquarter organisations of ground forces. For example, a Forward Operating Base or Patrol Base. 
It typically has poor communication links with limited, intermittent and often contested connections to other force elements. 
Channels vary widely from opportunistic use of local infrastructure, embedded/organic radios, local fibre cables and satellite links back to national strategic support.





Where assets (or space) are common to other devices, can exploit
zero-day or 'known' vulnerabilities. For example Kubernetes is
Kubernetes with a well-known build dependency, so quietly inserting code
into those is easier than into bespoke code written in a metal box by
cleared people.
