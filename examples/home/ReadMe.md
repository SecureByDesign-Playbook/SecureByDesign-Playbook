# Home Network Example

This is a worked example of the Quick Secure By Design Playbook for a home network, so that you can see how it works for something familiar. 

Bear in mind that for home or small office networks, or other 'standard' situations, then standard checklists or guidelines such as the UK NCSC Cyber Essentials may be faster and clearer.

### Assets & Uses

For example in our home networks we will have sensitive personal information about our families on home laptops or phones, some valuable gaming devices, and probably access to our financial assets at a bank. For each of these consider what the impact would be if you didn't have it any more, or if someone got a copy of it, or somebody fiddled with it.  [read more]

### Network

We draw out each device in our house, and then draw a line between it and the router that it connects to, depending on whether it is wifi (orange) or cable (blue). You should also include visitor and guest devices.

### Threats

For this playbook we focus on threat *actors*: people and groups that deliberately or accidentally
