# Small office Network Example

*To Develop:*

This is a worked example of the Quick Secure By Design Playbook for a small office network, so that you can see how it works for something familiar. 

Bear in mind that for small office networks, or other 'standard' situations, then standard checklists or guidelines such as the UK NCSC Cyber Essentials may be faster and clearer.
