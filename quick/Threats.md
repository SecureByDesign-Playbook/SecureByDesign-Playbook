Active **adversaries** (sometimes called threat *actors*) are people and groups that deliberately or accidentally compromise our assets.  The **threat** they pose depends on their **skills**, **tools**, and their **motivation** to attack **your spaces and assets**.

For a quick-start we will consider only a few main categories of attacker: "Criminals", "Competitors" and "Insiders", and we can use a coarse score "low", "medium" and "high" for their capability (skills, tools, experience, resources) and their motivation.  

For example:

| Adversary        | Capability | Motivation |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Criminal Hackers | High       | Low        |
| Competitors      | Medium     | Medium     |
| Insiders         | High       | High       |

If your environment is unusual have a look through the [Smart Threat Assessment](../smart/ThreatRegister.xlsx) registry and add any that are appropriate, but as usual keep it simple for the quick start. 

We provide a simple [Quick-start Threat Registry](../smart/ThreatRegister.xlsx); it's just a list as above. See also [Smart Threat Assessments](../smart/Threats.md) for more details and an [explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zwl-BxyUQg&list=PLKjQAPJ7DIEpwAtzMKIRAiOrNvuk4qjWb&index=3&t=63s).
