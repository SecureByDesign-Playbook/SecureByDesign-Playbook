For this playbook we focus on active **adversaries** (sometimes called threat *actors*): people and groups that deliberately or accidentally compromise our assets. 

> [!NOTE]

> Some risk assessment frameworks (such as NIST 800 3..) include natural threats such as earthquakes, but these can and should be managed in different ways; leave them out of this assessment. 

<img style="float: right; width: 25%" src="/quick/Threat - Burglar.png"/>Adversaries have a range of capabilities and motivations, both generally and when applied to our specific space and assets. 

To start with, use a coarse score for each of these rather than listing technical skills, tools and goals:

| Adversary      | Capability | General Motivation | Specific Motivation |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Script Kiddies | Low        | High               | Low                 |
| Competitors    | Medium     | Medium             | High                |
| ...            |            |                    |                     |
