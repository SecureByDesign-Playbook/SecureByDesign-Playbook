With our prioritised list of **vulnerabilities** we can consider options for defending them. 

Defences coarsely, consist of 'protect', 'detect' and 'respond' that correspond to the NIST CSF's sections:

* **Protect**: Prevent adversaries from accessing your assets
* **Detect:** Monitor systems to tell when adversaries have penetrated into the system
* **Respond:** Eject adversaries, restore bricked or tricked systems, mitigate against nicked data. 

We can then use the asset layout over the network to show us *where* these protections should be applied. 

The protection measures are called '**controls**'. These might be physical, technical or adminstration

* **Physical Controls:** eg fences, walls, locked doors, swipe-card access
* **Technical Controls:** eg password-protected access, phone authenticators, fingerprint or retinal scanners.
* **Administration Controls:** eg Security Clearances, references, training, behaviours

## Implementing the Controls

#### Communicating your plan

<img style="float: right; width: 25%" src="D:\Martins\Unusual Systems\Unusual Share - Documents\Cyber Security\SbD-Playbook@sbds\Playbook\Presentation.png"/>Your action plan needs to go to your business team who will be approving the financial spend. You have now both the costs and the risks, so all the information is here that they need.

It will then need to go to your technical team to implement the right controls. You should have the **attack vectors**  from your Security Picture, so the technical team will understand where to place the right controls to defeat the expected attacks. Ideally the team who will do this are the same people you have asked about the costs of the defences, so they are already aware and informed.
