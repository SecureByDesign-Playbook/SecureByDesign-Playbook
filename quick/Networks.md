# Quick Start: Cyber Space

Map out the space -  the computer networks - where your assets are located and moved through. Include:

* Storage and processing points: phones, laptops, computers, USB sticks, SD cards. What assets are held on these?
* Links between them: how are your assets moved between devices? This should include how users get to access the assets on those devices; how is the information moved from device to user?
* What defences are already in place on each route to prevent unauthorised access?
* Include physical as well as virtual computer network locations
* Include areas that you don't control but your assets still exist in or move through.

This can be a very high level diagram to start with; don't worry about all the various detailed technical links.

#####  Home Example

We draw out each device in our house, and then draw a line between it and the router that it connects to, depending on whether it is wifi (orange) or cable (blue). [Read more](./examples/home/)
