Draw out a linked diagram (a network) of what areas there are that have your valuable assets in them and the access routes, or communication links, between them. 

![NetworkExample](NetworkExample.png)

Draw on it where your assets are located or **stored** and the **routes** they move along.  

Include:

* **Stores** and **processing** devices: phones, laptops, computers, USB sticks, SD cards. 
  * What assets are held on these?

* Links that connect the devices that provide the **routes** your assets move along between devices.
  * Include how users get to access the assets on those devices; how does a user get to the asset? 

* Links that connect devices that *could* provide access to your assets. 
* **Defences** - security precautions - that are already in place.
* **Physical** as well as virtual computer network locations
* Areas that you **don't control** but your assets still exist in or move through.

This can be a very high level diagram, or even just a list of places, to start with; don't worry about all the various detailed technical links.
