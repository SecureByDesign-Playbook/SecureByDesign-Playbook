# Quick Start: Assets and Uses



 * Estimate their security value: 


    * What would the **impact** be if they were:

      * nicked (stolen or copied)
      * bricked (denied, destroyed, broken, lost)
      * or tricked (corrupted in some misleading way)?

   

 * This might include:

   * Valuable physical devices
   * Information 
   * Intangible things like reputation, trust, brand loyalty.

 * Prioritise the more valuable ones - the ones that would have greater impact if they were affected. Skip ones that are less relevant, and in the first round even those that you don't understand properly. Be quick, coarse, and rough with your estimates rather than exact and late.  

| Asset         | Uses                         | Nicked                                                  | Bricked                                              | Tricked                                              |

| What Thing... | ..is used by who to do what? | If it is stolen then what can someone find out from it? | If you can't use it, what are you also unable to do? | What false information on it might lead to problems? |

By doing this we not only remind ourselves what is actually important to us, but we can start to score these to compare them, and so prioritise which ones to focus on.

Where possible we should use the same units - eg money - to compare them, but if we include people then we might also include time, physical harm, emotional pain, etc.

See [Assets Assessments](assess/Assets.md) for more detail, a starter [Asset Register][assets/AssetsRegisterGuide.md], and this [explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afbq4GgeKDM&list=PLKjQAPJ7DIEpwAtzMKIRAiOrNvuk4qjWb&index=1&t=26s)

##### Home Example

In a home networks we will typically have sensitive personal information about our families on home laptops or phones, some valuable gaming devices, and probably access to our financial assets at a bank. For each of these consider what the impact would be if you didn't have it any more, or if someone got a copy of it, or somebody fiddled with it. [Read more](./examples/home/)
