Be clear about **what you are assessing**. 
  * Is it your current situation, or a future one?
  * Is it your manufacturing site, or the the one where your product will be used?

Be ready to **organise** the information you will be gathering:
  * What valuable assets you have. In simple cases a paper and pen will do; consider using a spreadsheet or a table.  
  * How your "cyber space" is arranged. Again, in simple cases a paper and pen, or powerpoint or similar; consider using professional network diagramming software

Find out **who** to ask about:
  * Your assets - who uses what? Probably 'users'
  * Your computer networks - what is on it? Where is it? Probably technical staff
  * Your "Risk Appetite" -  what do you care about or not? Probably managers

In many cases the answers to 'who?' might be 'you!'
