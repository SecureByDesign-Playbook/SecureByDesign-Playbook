# Action Plan

*To Develop:*

* Governing control deployments
  * Paying for it
  * Who does it
  * Confirming and testing it is done



#### Communicating your plan

<img style="float: right; width: 25%" src="Presentation.png"/>Your action plan needs to go to your business team who will be approving the financial spend. You have now both the costs and the risks, so all the information is here that they need.

It will then need to go to your technical team to implement the right controls. You should have the **attack vectors**  from your Security Picture, so the technical team will understand where to place the right controls to defeat the expected attacks. Ideally the team who will do this are the same people you have asked about the costs of the defences, so they are already aware and informed.
