# Assets, Uses and Impacts

Let's have a look at how to identify and describe the assets that matter

### What are Assets?

For these assessments your assets are those things that are *valuable* to you.

They might be:

* **physical** like cash, or people, or expensive devices
* **information** like your bank account details or commercial contracts
* **abstract** like a trustworthy reputation that you need to keep bringing in work.
* **communications** like work emails or phones 

...or anything else that would cost you or harm you if they were:

- **Bricked**: deleted, hidden, disabled, denied, destroyed.  Leaving your mobile phone in your washing is likely to turn it into an expensive brick.

- **Nicked**: copied, seen, derived, inferred. 

- **Tricked**: replaced, subverted, deceived. 

Think about what each asset is used for, and so what impact there would be on you if any of the above happened. 

For example you might have a work mobile phone that you use to reach your customers. If it is bricked then you will immediately lose not only any customer numbers on it, but if you call on a different number they will not recognise it is yours. If it is nicked you have the same problem, but also the chance that whoever stole it runs up your bill or starts calling around your customers being a nuisance. It may be tricked by someone spoofing the telephone number and pretending to be you.

Some of these will matter more to you than others. 

### A Starter List

Just some ideas to help you create your list; valuable assets might be:

- Research & Development data and activity

- Academic research data

- IP, such as product formulas or blueprints

- Salaries, bonus structures and other sensitive finance

- Client or customer lists and payment structures

- Business goals, strategic plans and marketing tactics

- Political strategies, affiliations and communications

- Military or business intelligence

### Your Asset Register

Just like a school attendance register, your asset register should list the assets that are present. 

There will likely to be lots of these, so start with the major ones. We have provided a starter [Asset Register](../smart/AssetRegisterGuide.md]) to help you with some drop-down selections to help you grade which impacts are more serious than others. 

These grades come from the NIST Risk Framework so are reasonably well established, but as usual don't get too buried in the detail in your first iterations.

### Supply Chains

Don't forget that some of your assets might be supplied by other people, and may be made of components that have been supplied by even more other people. These can be attacked too, either directly while you're using them, or while they are being made.

## Uses & Users

Knowing who uses your assets for what will help you understand:

* What the impacts are if the assets are stolen, broken, or altered
* how assets move, for example between where they are stored and where they are used
* What alternatives there might be (ie, using different systems to get the same solution)
* What you need to protect from your own security protections! You might be tempted to disable access to a system, but this is a way of checking that access is not already in legitimate use. 

### Impacts and Targets

What are the consequences of the asset being affected? These will likely be different for different kinds of effects. If you don't have good security on your mobile then having it stolen could be much worse than running over it with a car. 

For each effect (ie nick, brick and trick) work out:

* What and who is impacted?
* How severely? Terminally catastrophic, serious, severe, significant, trivial?

Typically you will measure the commercial impact in time or money, but in your case you might want to use other measures such as harm, time, reputation, delays to a goal, and so on.
