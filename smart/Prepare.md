* Be clear about **what you are assessing**. 
  * In the software world, we are typically developing a system to be used by someone else. 
  * We need therefore to assess the risks the *deployed* system has, and also the risks to the *development team*. These are two different assessments.
* Have a place to **register what assets you have where**. 
  * We provide a [starter spreadsheet](AssetRegister.xlsx) for you to record onto, but your workplace may already have asset registers so see what already exists.
* Be able to **explore and map your networks**. 
  * To start with this can be diagrams of the main store and processing points and the links between them, or just 'zone' blobs.
  * At some point you will need to properly check what actual equipment is where and what the actual connections are between them. 
  * There are various tools for this and we will cover them later, but you will probably need to draw on technical expertise too.
* Have a place to **register threats**. 
  * We provide a [starter spreadsheet](ThreatRegister.xlsx) for you to use, but you will probably need to tailor it and add to it for your own specific situation.
* Have **a 'Risk Register'**. 
  * Most projects should have this already, even if it is largely in people's heads. 
  * You will need to transfer your Cyber Security risk assessment to business terms, so get ready to talk to speak managementese.
