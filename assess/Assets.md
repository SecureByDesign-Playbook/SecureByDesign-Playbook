# A Dive into Assets, Uses and Impacts

Let's have a look at how to identify and describe the assets that matter

### What are Assets?

For these assessments your assets are those things that are *valuable* to you.

They might be:

* **physical** like cash, or people, or expensive devices
* **information** like your bank account details or commercial contracts
* **abstract** like a trustworthy reputation that you need to keep bringing in work.
* **communications** like work emails or phones 

...or anything else that would cost you or harm you if they were::

- **Bricked**: deleted, hidden, disabled, denied, destroyed.  Leaving your mobile phone in your washing is likely to turn it into an expensive brick.

- **Nicked**: copied, seen, derived, inferred. 

- **Tricked**: replaced, subverted, deceived. 

Think about what each asset is used for, and so what impact there would be on you if any of the above happened. 

For example you might have a work mobile phone that you use to reach your customers. If it is bricked then you will immediately lose not only any customer numbers on it, but if you call on a different number they will not recognise it is yours. If it is nicked you have the same problem, but also the chance that whoever stole it runs up your bill or starts calling around your customers being a nuisance. It may be tricked by someone spoofing the telephone number and pretending to be you.

Some of these will matter more to you than others. 

#### Your Asset Register

Just like a school attendance register, your asset register should list the assets that are present. 

There will likely to be lots of these, so start with the major ones. We have provided a starter [Asset Register][assets/AssetsRegister.ods] to help you; this can look a bit overwhelming at first, but it's just a list a bit like this:

| Asset         | Uses                         | Nicked                                                  | Bricked                                              | Tricked                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| What Thing... | ..is used by who to do what? | If it is stolen then what can someone find out from it? | If you can't use it, what are you also unable to do? | What false information on it might lead to problems? |

...with some drop-down selections to help you grade which impacts are more serious than others. These grades come from the NIST Risk Framework so are reasonably well established, but as usual don't get too buried in the detail

Locations or Devices are not necessarily assets by themselves; what unless only when they enable information use. That is

What is the impact if an asset is:

- 



How do we measure the impact:

- Units: money, lives, calendar time, effort, reputation

- Extent: catastrophic, damaging, trivial

- Effect on goal/mission

Where assets (or space) are common to other devices, can exploit
zero-day or 'known' vulnerabilities. For example Kubernetes is
Kubernetes with a well-known build dependency, so quietly inserting code
into those is easier than into bespoke code written in a metal box by
cleared people.

Cyber spies most commonly attempt to access the following assets:

- Research & Development data and activity

- Academic research data

- IP, such as product formulas or blueprints

- Salaries, bonus structures and other sensitive information regarding
  organizational finances and expenditures

- Client or customer lists and payment structures

- Business goals, strategic plans and marketing tactics

- Political strategies, affiliations and communications

- Military intelligence
