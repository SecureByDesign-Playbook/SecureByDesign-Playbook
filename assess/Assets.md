# Assets, Uses, Effects & Impacts



- For this study, information assets are the main focus.Â 

  - Threats may use these to target people and military fighting kit,
    but our focus here is on the systems under study.

- Locations or Devices should be assets only when they enable
  information use

What is the impact if an asset is:

- Bricked: deleted, hidden, disabled, denied

- Nicked: copied, seen, derived, inferred

- Tricked: replaced, subverted, deceiving

How do we measure the impact:

- Units: money, lives, calendar time, effort, reputation

- Extent: catastrophic, damaging, trivial

- Effect on goal/mission

Where assets (or space) are common to other devices, can exploit
zero-day or 'known' vulnerabilities. For example Kubernetes is
Kubernetes with a well-known build dependency, so quietly inserting code
into those is easier than into bespoke code written in a metal box by
cleared people.

Cyber spies most commonly attempt to access the following assets:

- Research & Development data and activity

- Academic research data

- IP, such as product formulas or blueprints

- Salaries, bonus structures and other sensitive information regarding
  organizational finances and expenditures

- Client or customer lists and payment structures

- Business goals, strategic plans and marketing tactics

- Political strategies, affiliations and communications

- Military intelligence
