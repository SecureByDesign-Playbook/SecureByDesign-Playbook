# Threats - Background

This explains where our guide came from, and why it is the form it is, and what you might do about it.

We started with a set of threat actors given by NIST SP 800.53 Table D, extracted a systematic set of Threat Actor Categories (eg "Individual/Group", "Proximity eg Insider/Outsider", "Professional Motivation") and built these out into a more rigorous combination of Threat Actor types, with some examples.

Capabilities at the initial stage are intentionally broad; they should reflect the skills, tools, experience and supplementary resources available to the Threat Actor, but we do not need to be very fine-grained about each of these to begin with. 

Finally we need to distinguish between those who are generally motivated to attack whatever is to hand (opportunistic or scans), and those who are specifically motived to attack you.
