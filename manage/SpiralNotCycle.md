# Spiral, Don't Cycle

[It's time to retire the crap circle](https://hbr.org/2013/03/its-time-to-retire-crap-circle)

## Skim First

Do it quickly then do it slowly - and then again at whatever detail you need.

You can work through this playbook the first time in detail, but it can be hard to consider each aspect in isolation as you work through it. Instead run through it first, quickly, at a high level.  After that you should have enough understanding to decide whether to pick and choose particular aspects to focus on, or repeatedly run through the whole playbook each time examining each aspect more closely.

This also means that by the time you get to focus on the detail, you can put the various components in proper context and so direct that focus suitably.

## Improve Understanding

Each pass of the playbook should give you better understanding of the situation and what you can do about it. It should help you spiral towards good, rigorous, appropriate security rather than just cycling around a dead process.
