## Why?

To understand our security we must understand our adversary[^1]. More specifically we need sufficient evidence about relevant threats, in enough time, to allow for good, informed decisions.

Successful threat intelligence helps security teams to better understand previous, existing, and emerging threats; encouraging them to shift from reactive to proactive responses. 

Identifying and profiling potential threats effectively leads to better detection, prevention, and remediation, because security teams can then put in place the most effective solutions for those particular threats.
