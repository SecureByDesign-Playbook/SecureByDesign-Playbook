# Secure By Design Playbooks

This is a guide, with supporting material, to help you **assess security risks** for your small to medium size IT project.  It is intended for both technical and **non-technical staff**, at least during the early iterations, to help you **understand the interplay of risk costs and benefits**.

This is different from using checklists of controls or mitigations (such as [NCSC's Cyber Essentials](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/)). Checklists can be quick, easy to use, and useful, but in unusual systems and circumstances such checklists can cause more harm than good.  The approach given here will show you how to rigorously approach security, with the right artefacts to engage with your security experts and auditors, for your situation. 

In particular this playbook will help you comply with the UK government's [Secure By Design](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/secure-by-design/). It implements [NIST's Cyber Security Frameork](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) and [Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf) which are widely recognised and will be familiar to your cyber security advisors and auditors. The ready-made templates use these, but you can replace these with your own or others. These are combined into a risk assessment including likely adversary courses of action and what to monitor for, using an approach similar to western military "Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield".

We have provided [some examples here](./examples/).

## Start

Want to just get started? Go straight to the [Quick Start Guide](QuickStart.md) or even just start the [Playbook](Playbook.md)

## Background 

[Why SbD?](about/WhySbD.md)  Security is already designed into most systems; why do we need a concept called 'Secure By Design'? 

[Why this playbook?](about/WhyPlaybook.md)  What this gives you on top of the existing cyber security frameworks

## Managing your Assessment

[Spirals not Cycles: Managing your assessments](./manage/SpiralNotCycle.md): Iterate - do it quickly and then again slowly, and then again at whatever detail you need. 

[Security Terms and Concepts](./explain/TermsAndConcepts.md):  The process is outlined here with the terms used in the playbook, along with some other commonly used ones so you can see how they relate. 

## Adding to this Project

Help us improve: what terms here do you find alien, what would you use? What analogies or stories might you bring to help explain some concepts?
